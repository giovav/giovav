# 🥸 Talking about serious stuff… or at least trying to.
I’m a **Computer Science student** currently on a journey to write better code and understand what makes software good (not just work 😅).
I’m diving into software engineering principles, clean code, and building things that (hopefully) don’t break too often.

> Always learning, always refactoring 🥲.

Thanks for stopping by 👨‍💻💖

## 📚 What I’m Learning
I’m focusing on:
- Software engineering fundamentals
- Writing maintainable and testable code
- Collaborative development with Git & GitHub (when it's possible)

## 🚀 Projects
A few things I’ve been working on:
- 💡 University assignments – exploring algorithms, OOP, and more
- 🧪 Practice repos – experimenting and improving day by day

**🫢 Thanks for reading !** 

Hope you found something interesting (If not… well, I’m **working on it** 😅)
