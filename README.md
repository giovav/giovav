# 👋 Hi there!

![Me](https://tenor.com/view/snoopy-sad-cry-tantrums-tears-gif-16441308)

I'm a Computer Science student using GitHub mainly for learning and personal growth.  
Most of the repositories you'll find here are **educational projects**, **experiments**, or exercises as I explore how to write better, cleaner, and more maintainable code.

---

## 🛠️ What I'm doing here:

- Practicing software development the right way (or trying to)
- Learning by doing – even when it breaks
- Building small things to understand big concepts

---

## 📚 Current focus:

- Programming fundamentals and clean code
- Version control and collaborative workflows
- Web development & backend basics
- Getting familiar with open-source tools and practices

---

## ❓ Serious projects?

Not yet — I’m still learning and experimenting.  
I don’t have any major collaborations going on right now, but who knows? I’m open to opportunities in the future.

## ☕ Let's connect

Feel free to check out what I’m working on, or reach out if you have advice, ideas, or just want to say hi.
